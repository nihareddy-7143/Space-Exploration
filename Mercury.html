<strong>Orbit and Rotation:</strong>

<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, with an average distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers).<br>
    It takes approximately 88 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.<br>
    Mercury has a slow rotation on its axis, taking about 59 Earth days to complete one rotation. However, its day-night cycle is about 176 Earth days due to its peculiar rotation characteristics.</p>
<strong>Size and Composition:</strong>

<p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles).<br>
    It has a rocky, cratered surface and is composed mostly of silicate rock and metal.</p>

<strong>Extreme Temperaturres:</strong>

<P>Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations due to its proximity to the Sun. Daytime temperatures can soar up to around 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit), while nighttime temperatures can plummet to about -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit).</P>

<strong>Thin Atmosphere</strong>

<p>Mercury has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere, known as an exosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen. However, it's so thin that it can't trap and hold heat, contributing to the planet's extreme temperature differences.</p>
<strong>Historical Observations:</strong>

<p>Mercury has been known since ancient times and was observed by civilizations such as the Babylonians and Greeks. However, due to its proximity to the Sun, observing Mercury from Earth can be challenging.</p>
<strong>Formation</strong>
<p>Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p>
<strong>Magnetosphere</strong>
<p>Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>
